#Variables

**Variables** act as named containers where the programmer can store values that will be changing in their programs.

The keyword ```var``` is used to tell the computer that the next word in the program will be a user-defined *identifier*  This *varible-name* acts as a label to identify an area in the computer's main memory where the programmer can store and modify values to make the program more flexible. 

**Declare and initialize a variable:**

```var mySpecialValue = 5; ```

```mySpecialValue = 15;```

The code above creates a variable ```mySpecialVariable```, and assigns the value 5 to it. The second line of code changes the value stored in the memory location: ``mySpecialVariable``  to 15.
