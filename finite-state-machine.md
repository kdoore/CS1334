###Finite State Machine

Finite State Machine (FSM) is abstraction to simplify reasoning about complex, event driven systems.

To represent a system as a finite state machine, it is necessary to identify all possible states for the system, and to identify all possible events that can change the state of the system.

Once a system has been defined using FSM notation, it becomes easier to design the program logic for implementing the animation.

FSM's are commenly used to control animation logic.  The Unity plugin, Playmaker, uses finite state machine logical structure to create visual scripting interface.  FSM's work well for game scripting because games can be understood as a series of events, that change the state of the system.  An event causes a state-change and that can trigger an action to occur. Unity has Mechanim which is a visual scripting enviornment for creating animations, and it uses finite state machine logic for controlling the animations.
